## Project_Overview
The next phase focuses on visualizing the data to gain a thorough understanding of the national survey results. This process includes generating visuals that involve calculating extra fields such as the average queue time per water source, categorizing sources based on basic or below-basic access, estimating costs for improvements, and mapping pollution, crime data, and water insights. These steps enhanced the data's value and depth of analysis.

* Queue times typically peak both before and after regular business hours, with significant variations based on location and time of day. On average, the longest waits are observed on weekends and early mornings. For instance, in cities like Sokoto, average wait times can exceed one hour.

* Saturdays experience particularly long queue times, reaching up to 5 hours, possibly due to reduced water supply over the weekend, while the shortest lines are recorded on Wednesdays.

* Shared taps are the most prevalent water source, used by more than 40% of the population, serving around 12 million users. However, this heavy reliance on shared taps leads to extended wait times, which can stretch up to eight hours. Wells are the second most common source, used by up to 20% of the population.

* Women account for over 65% of those waiting in queues. In the Kilimani District, women spend more than three times longer in queues compared to men, possibly due to limited water access in Sokoto.

* Hawassa Province stands out with significantly shorter wait times, likely due to better water infrastructure and a smaller population relative to its water sources.

* Rural areas, in general, face longer queues than urban centers, likely due to fewer water access points. Addressing this disparity by developing more water sources in rural regions could help reduce wait times.

* Access to safe water sources is notably lower in rural areas, with over 60% of the rural population relying on rivers, compared to just 5% in urban areas. Significant investment is needed to close this gap.

* Over 70% of well samples reveal chemical or biological contamination, with provinces like Hawassa facing substantial challenges in water quality due to both types of contamination.

* Crime rates at water sources spike on weekends and after dark, with women facing twice the risk of becoming victims of crimes such as harassment and assault compared to men while collecting water. There appears to be a correlation between water access issues and higher crime rates near water sources, as cities with longer queues tend to report more incidents at these points.
