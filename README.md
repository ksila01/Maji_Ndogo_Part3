## Project_Overview
The national dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of water access in the Maji Ndogo region. It highlights key metrics, including population breakdown, challenges, budget allocations, current access levels, and the costs associated with improving water sources. This dashboard serves both as a tool for public transparency and as a vital resource for decision-makers to monitor and guide the ongoing project.
